QR Menu Saver

## Getting Started

This project is for users to save their links, spesificly in the interest of QR Code Menus.

- Inside there is a qr scanner which can scan and go to the scanned url.

- Later user can go to the saved url's page to see which urls they have went to previously.

- In there they can also add url's they want to favorites to be displayed in different page.

- Inside favorites, user can set a new name to the link instead of having the link as a name.
